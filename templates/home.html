        <h3> <i>Aspiring Data Scientist</i> </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
            I am an aspiring data scientist who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in mathematics, statistics, and computer science.
            <br />
            <br />
            My passion lies in solving problems using historical data, machine learning models and algorithms, and communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. I am able to jump across verticals to deliver high-performing and visually appealing solutions.

        <h1>Get to Know Me</h1>
        <p>
            I grew up in Portland, OR. At the age of 15, I attended Portland Community College, where I received my high
            school diploma and Oregon Transfer Degree. It was here that my passion for academia, specifically mathematics,
            computer science, and statistics flourished. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics,
            with Minors in Computer Science and Statistics from Oregon State University in December 2019.
            At Oregon State University, I discovered my interest in research, and had the opportunity to work on several
            exciting research projects - including working with a team to discover a new way to generate the Euler Phi Function!
            <br />

            <br />
            <br />
        <p>
            Throughout my academic career, I’ve taken on various leadership roles, including mentoring three
            undergraduate interns, coordinating institute-wide research events for hundreds of people, and leading
            weekly research meetings.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a business analyst at JH Kelly, I create machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis, design and
            generate company dashboards using Tableau and PowerBI data modeling software to present data in a functional
            way, lead several development projects internally developed software, write project proposals, organize and
            present weekly updates for various on-going projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a data science intern for the University of Washington Academic Experience Design & Delivery Team, I
            apply data mining techniques, conduct statistical analysis, and build machine learning models to be
            integrated with existing and future products used to provide analytical tools for students, faculty,
            and staff.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am currently a full-time graduate student in the UW Master of Science in Data Science program and will be
            graduating in March 2022. While here, I have had the opportunity to work on several fascinating projects
            and have been obtaining experience working on machine learning and with real world datasets.
            As a data analyst at JH Kelly, I design and generate company dashboards using Tableau data modeling
            software to present data in a functional way. I also work on development projects, write project proposals,
            and organize and present weekly updates for various on-going projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            My hobbies include hiking, painting, building robots and models, and recently - sky diving!
            I am also teaching myself to play the keyboard and learning how to speak German.
            Aber ich brauche noch viel Übung!

        <h1>Currently Working On</h1>
        <p>
        My focus lately has been getting more experience with machine learning and mastering techniques for processing
        large amounts of data, using programs such as using MapReduce and Spark. I have also been learning how to utilize algorithms such as
        Frequent Itemsets and Association Rules, Near Neighbor Search in High Dimensional Data,
        Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), Dimensionality Reduction, and Recommendation Systems.
        </br>
        One of my current academic projects includes building a Content and Collaborative Based Deep Learning
        Recommendation System with my colleagues. Our recommendation system will consist of multiple neural networks,
        as well as a linear regression and K-Means model. We will be utilizing the SmartcastTV proprietary dataset,
        as Smartcast TV is interested in using our research to improve their current recommendation system.
        Our goal is to create a recommendation system that can tackle efficiently tackle the Long Tail and
        Cold Start problems common to recommendation systems efficiently.

        <h1>Research Interests</h1>
        <p>
        As I learn more about various fields, my interests are continuously reshaping and developing. In general, I am interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
        </br>
        I am most passionate about how we can apply Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to a wide array of fields
        such as Sociology, Climatology, Geology, Biology, and Space Exploration.
        </br>
        Another interest of mine is quantum machine learning. I have begun research in my spare time about this
        fascinating topic, and have plans for future projects merging the world of machine learning with quantum
        algorithms.

        <h1>Aspirations</h1>

        <p>
            My future career goals are to work with a team that provides data analytics, visualization,
            and general consulting to projects that improve the environment and society in a sustainable way. Ideally
            this goal would allow me to expand upon the skills I have learned in mathematics, statistics,
            and programming.
            </br>
            I would like to pursue a career in research where I will be able to continue carving meaningful
            information from mountains of data, while working on new and innovative projects.
